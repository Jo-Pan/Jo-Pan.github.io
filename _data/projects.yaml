projects:
  - title: "Scientific Publications Information Retrieval"
    subtitle: "Large-scale datasets and LLM evaluation"
    description: >
      Created datasets like DMDD, SciDMT, and ClimatePubNER for domain-specific named entity annotations.
      Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama) for named entity recognition, relationship detection, and summarization.
      Developed a climate science knowledge graph using Neo4j, GraphRAG, LlamaIndex, and LLM techniques.
